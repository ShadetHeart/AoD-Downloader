Python3 script that Downloads animes from the website "Anime on Demand".
A subscribed account and a copy of ffmpeg.exe (https://ffmpeg.org/)
are required for this to work.

Setup:
1. install python3
2. use pip to install requests ("pip install requests" in commandline/powershell)
2. download latest ffmpeg, put ffmpeg.exe in the same folder as the script
3. run, input login data and URL of the anime.

Currently the video can only be downloaded in highest quality.
If not renamed/moved, already downloaded episodes will be skipped if the
script is run again at a later point in time.
